<h1 style="color:black; text-align:center; font-size: 40px " ; class='p1' > About S.E.A. Aquarium</h1>
    
    <p style="text-align:center"; style="font-family:sans-serif"> 
        It has been called many names: Sentosa Aquarium, Southeast Asia Aquarium and Singapore Aquarium. But the actual way to say it is <b>"Sea Aquarium"</b>.
        <br>
        <br>
        The S.E.A Aquarium first opened in November 2012 and currently holds the title of the 3rd  world's largest and most stunning aquarium, which has over 12 million gallons of water. It had the world's largest viewing panel, 36-metre (118 ft) wide and 8.3-metre (27 ft) tall, which aims to give visitors the experience of being on the ocean floor.
        <br>
        <br>
         It has over <a href="https://www.rwsentosa.com/en/attractions/sea-aquarium/things-to-do/animals"; target="_blank"> 100,000 marine animals</a> of over 1,000 species, living across 49 different habitats. It has 10 different zones in the aquarium which replicates different ocean habitats that various marine animals used to live in.  
        <br>
        <br>
         It is a rare sight with the man-eating sharks, coral reefs, and other exotic marine animals such as the Giant Crab, Hammerhead Shark, Reef Manta Ray and Giant Moray Eel. It is a sight and marine experience not to be missed! </p>

  <p style="text-align:center"; style="font-family:sans-serif">In the above map and video, it shows that it is actually pretty much a one-way loop which ensures that you would have explored everything that is available!

BUT it does not hurt to plan ahead and know what to look out for to appreciate the trip better, hence I will share with you the visiting order of attractions of the place and my inputs in each!
<br><br>
   <b><u>1. Shipwreck Habitat </u></b><br>
   This is the first exhibit you will encounter. It displays how shipwrecks can develop over time into flourishing marine habitats full of sponges and corals. You can view this view via the flat viewing panel or walkthrough tunnel.
   <br><br>
   <img src="Shipwreck1.jpg" alt="Me posing at Ship Wreck Habitat" class="center" width="700" height="500">
   <br>
   <b>Watch out for:</b> </p>
<ul>
     <li>The critically endangered bowmouth guitarfish which is hard to breed as little is known about them.</li>
 <li>Vanda the miracle baby (Watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4B3ZvehKUA"; target="_blank">video</a> to find out more).</li></ul>
     
   <p style="text-align:center"; style="font-family:sans-serif"><b>
    
   <u>2. Shark Seas Habitat  </u></b><br>
   As you move along, you will be enjoying the view of alpha predators of the ocean without being eaten. This exhibit consists of more than 70 sharks from 12 different species. Sharks are commonly misunderstood due to the negative portrayal in news and even films(e.g Jaws). You will be more about their importance in maintaining the ocean ecosystem.
   <br><br>
   <img src="SharkSea1.jpg" alt="Shark Seas Habitat" class="center" width="700" height="500">
   <br>
    
    <br>
   <b>Watch out for:</b> </p>
<ul>
     <li>The Sand Tiger Shark with protruding teeth. Looking at its eyes will explain immediately why they are the apex predators of the seas. (You can see in the two pictures)</li>
     <li> The Scalloped HammerHead Shark that has 360- degree vision and is currently endangered.</li></ul>
      
     <img src="SharkSea2.jpg" alt="Shark Seas Habitat" class="center" width="700" height="500">
   
     <p style="text-align:center"; style="font-family:sans-serif"> 
      
   <b><u>3. Coral Garden </u></b><br>
     Despite its name, there are no corals in it. This is a cylindrical habitat that is 8m tall and 6m in diameter. It displays a vibrant multicoloured reef world housing 5000 fishes from more than 100 species. The corals look real but they are actually artificial! This is because reef-eating fishes will destroy the corals if placed inside the habitat? Then are there live corals in the visit? Read on to find out more!
     <br><br>
      <img src="Coral1.jpg" alt="Coral Garden" class="center" width="700" height="500">
      <br>
      There are also other reef habitats nearby which display moving colours of the ocean.  To me it felt like a rainbow coming to life that seemed really natural which is pleasing for the eyes.
      <br><br>
      <img src="Coral2.jpg" alt="Coral Garden" class="center" width="700" height="500">
  <br>
   <b>Watch out for:</b> </p>
<ul>
     <li>The Napoleon Wrasse that is important to the coral reef ecosystem. The reason is because they consume crown-of-thorn starfish that damage the coral reefs. </li>
     <li> If you have watched the movie “Finding Nemo”, you try to look out for Dory, Nemo and his best friends.</li>
     <li> Personally I enjoyed staring at the sea anemones and different coloured fishes in the tank. I was totally absorbed by its beauty, you can try it too!</li></ul>
      
    <p style="text-align:center"; style="font-family:sans-serif">   
   <b><u>4. Open Ocean Gallery  </u></b><br>
     This habitat is the S.E.A. Aquarium's masterpiece. It is the size of 7 Olympic Swimming Pools (18 million litres of water) and is home to 120 species of animals. Interestingly, it is certified as a full open water dive site due to its size, volume and water motions. Dive lessons are suspended temporarily due to COVID, so once it reopens, you consider getting certified here than overseas. <br><br>
     
     <img src="Open1.png" alt="Open Ocean Gallery" class="center" width="700" height="500">
     <br>
   <b>Watch out for:</b> Three manta ray that are the Mascots of the S.E.A Aquarium  </p>
<ul>
     <li>Mika has a black stripe on his underside,and is fond of somersaulting underwater during feeding time. </li>
     <li> Mako is the largest manta ray  with an almost fully black body and charismatic presence.</li>
     <li> Manja is the smallest and has a heart-shaped mark on his underside. It likes swimming around the aquarists during feeding time.</li></ul>

   <b><u>5. Sea Jellies Gallery </u></b><br>

   <p style="text-align:center"; style="font-family:sans-serif">
      <i>Looking at the white spotted sea jelly and thinking how similar it is to egg whites.</i>
   <br><br>
    
    It is one of the most beautiful places in the aquarium. The exhibits are enhanced by special lighting which accentuate the hydrodynamics in the sea jellies. It is a fascinating gelatinous-like animal made up of 95 percent water and has no brains, bones, blood, fins or teeth. So far there are only 6 species that are successfully bred in the aquarium. I personally think that the moon sea jelly and white spotted sea jelly are the nicest among all.

    <b>Watch out for:</b>  </p>
   
     <ul>
     <li>Moon sea jelly which is the most beautiful one if I had to compare with the white spotted sea jelly. Let me show you a snippet of my view. </li>

      <i>While enjoying the view, it reminded me of Doraemon's favourite snack (Dorayaki).</i></p>
     
   <p style="text-align:center"; style="font-family:sans-serif ">  
     
   <b><u>6. Freshwater Native Species </u></b><br>Have a look at some freshwater species. They are not visually appealing as compared to the saltwater species but there are interesting characteristics and abilities that they possess to survive in their environment. 
  <br><br>
<img src="Frog.png" alt="Native Species" class="center" width="600" height="700">
  <br>
   
<b>Watch out for:</b>   The paddlefish and alligator gars which have survived since the dino age and have remained about the same from hundred million years ago. Also, look out for the colourful poison arrow frogs and the new Rainforest Habitat!</p>

     <p style="text-align:center"; style="font-family:sans-serif ">
   <b><u>7. Live Coral Collection </u></b><br>

     <br><br>
            Now it comes to the million dollar question you have been waiting for, is there live corals? Yes, there is, in fact S.E.A. Aquarium has one of the largest live coral displays globally but just that it is not in the Coral Garden(despite its name)!There is a segment which shows the culturing of corals using a process called fragging.

 <p style="text-align:center"; style="font-family:sans-serif ">
   <b><u>1. Advice on what to Expect and Prepare </u></b><br>

<ul>
     <li>I would recommend taking 2-3 hours to explore all sections of S.E.A Aquarium sufficiently.</li>
<li>There are interactive learning panels on the side which explains more details of the species you are viewing. Do check them out to enhance your learning and enjoyment.</li>
<li>Wear light clothing and a comfortable pair of shoes as you will be walking and standing most of the time.</li>
<li>Do not worry if visiting with seniors or children as there are designated sitting areas inside.</li>
<li>Try not to bring anything too heavy in S.E.A Aquarium. If you really need a locker, the nearest place is at The Forum B1.</li>
<li>If you have a baby, I highly recommend small strollers as there is a lot of walking and strollers are not available for rent inside the aquarium.</li>
<li>If you wish to smoke, take note that you will have to head to the designated smoking area located outside of the aquarium as it is prohibited inside.</li>
<li>Take note that all shows, public feeding sessions and character meet-and-greet are currently unavailable till further notice. To know more, click <a href="https://www.rwsentosa.com/en/attractions/sea-aquarium/daily-shows"; target="_blank">here</a>.</li>

   <b><u> 2. Photography Tips </u></b><br>   
Want to take nice pictures but do not know how? Well I can guide you along with some short photography tips to up your photo game! 

<br><br>
<u>Use different colours to find a desirable picture (For Jellyfish aquarium) </u>
<br>
<img src="phototip1.jpeg" alt=" Sea Jellies Habitats" class="center" width="1000" height="450">
<br>
Different coloured background creates a different vibe for each photo. If you are not photo savvy like me, take yourself with all the colours and pick the nicest one out of all! 
<br><br>
<u>Take photos of yourself looking gently at the animal eyes </u>

<img src="phototip2.png" alt=" Stare with Love" class="center" width="800" height="500">

Look at the animal like how you will look at your wife or loved ones, and have a relaxed pose! <br>
<i>*Do not take photos with a flash (Light will reflect off the glass and it creates stress towards the animals)</i>

<br><br>

<u>Try a back or a side shot with silhouette </u>
<img src="Jelly2.jpg" alt="Sea Jellies Gallery" class="center" width="700" height="500">
It works most of the time especially in dark areas whereby there is no point taking a frontal shot since it is pretty dark. 
<br><br>
<u>Smile with your mask on! </u>
<img src="phototip4.jpg" alt="Posing with Diver" class="center" width="600" height="800">

Despite the mask which covers your mouth, you can smile through your eyes! Also, it is a rare chance but if you spot a diver, you can take a photo with them.They are usually friendly and initiative in taking a photo with you too!

<br><br>

<b><u> 3. Shopping and Dining </u></b><br> 

<img src="seafoodjoke.jpg" alt=" Fisherman Notebook" class="center" width="600" height="800">  
After a long walk and seeing so many exotic animals, you might be hungry and start thinking about Unagi Don, Sashimi, Sambal Stingray and other seafood delicacies. There are some places that you can visit! </p></h3>
